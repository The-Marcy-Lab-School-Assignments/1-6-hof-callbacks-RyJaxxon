# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
An inline function is a function defined directly where you would invoke a callback function in a HOF. 
```
const add = ((x,y) => {
    return x + y
})(5,10);
```

# Teacher Feedback

Your definition makes sense however your example is just showing the callback function! It is not in the context of a higher order function. Here is what an example could look like: 

`const screamAtEveryone = (msg, () => {`${msg}.toUpperCase()`});`
