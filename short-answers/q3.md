# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
The '()' after printDouble makes it so that the actual return value of printDouble is being called to .sort() instead of the callback itself, to remedy this we'd just need to change it to nums.forEach(printDouble);
